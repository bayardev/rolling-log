# Using RollingLog

- [Installation](#installation)

## Installation

RollingLog is available on Packagist ([bayardev/rolling-log](http://packagist.org/packages/bayardev/rolling-log))
and as such installable via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require bayardev/rolling-log
```

If you do not use Composer, you can grab the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/bayardev/rolling-log), and use any
PSR-0 compatible autoloader (e.g. the [Symfony2 ClassLoader component](https://github.com/symfony/ClassLoader))
to load RollingLog classes.
